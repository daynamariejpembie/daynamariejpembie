- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dayna-Marie Pemberton.
- I am a passionate front-end developer with expertise in React, JavaScript, and TypeScript. I have a strong drive to continuously learn and adopt new skills and technologies. As a problem solver who thrives on delivering, I take a solution-oriented approach to every challenge. My focus is on building efficient, scalable, and user-friendly applications while always seeking opportunities for growth and improvement. I am able to build projects with and without the help of frameworks. I am also an avid google searcher and will not stop until my problem is solved.
